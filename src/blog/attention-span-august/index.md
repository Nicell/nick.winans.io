This August, I'm taking a month-long break from social media and recommendation algorithms[^1]. This is a personal challenge to see how it affects my attention span, productivity, and overall mental health.

## Why?

We all know that social media and their recommendation algorithms are made to keep us engaged for as long as possible. They do a really good job at it, and I often find myself scrolling mindlessly, every once in a while becoming self-aware and wondering why I just wasted a minute watching a clip of a show I've never even heard of.

Six months ago, I installed [ScreenZen](https://www.screenzen.co), an app designed to stop the doomscrolling and give you back your time and attention. I created a 15 minute limit per app per day, and it helped me reduce my screen time immensely. At the same time it's created a new habit and feeling that somehow might feel even worse.

Now that I have a set limit per day, I _need_ to use every minute to its fullest _every_ day. During an app session there's no going to search up something that piqued my interest; I can't waste my precious seconds on that. Video or post not interesting enough? Swipe away fast to get to the next thing that may be more worth it. It's become a chore of maximizing as much entertainment as I can. And I feel _anxious_ going through this ritual every day.

Why should I continue this?

## What will I do instead?

I want to spend more time creating things. I find more fulfillment in the things I've made. When I look back on years prior, I don't think I could tell you about one truly meaningful TikTok or Twitter post I saw. What I create is what comes to mind, and it defines my own self-image. I'm going to write more and [build](/blog/ink-link/) more [things](/blog/perfect-keyboard) to nurture that.

Of course, life can't be all output. My consumption needs a change of pace, too. Embarrassingly, I'll admit that I finally read a book in full for the first time since _middle school_ this month. And it was great! I want to read more books and watch more shows (yes, even _The Wire_). I'll actually have a chance at remembering them in a few years.

## Join me!

If you've ever felt that same anxiety, that sense of time wasted on digital chores, consider this your sign.

[^1]: I'll likely keep YouTube, but I'll disable the home page and recommendation bar. I'll only watch a few subscriptions and videos I find externally or specifically search for.
